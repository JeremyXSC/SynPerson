# Rethinking Illumination for Person Re-Identification: A Unified View
### [Suncheng Xiang](https://JeremyXSC.github.io/)
### [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)

## Overview
In this work, we manually construct a large-scale synthetic dataset named SynPerson, which has diversified human characters and distinguished attributes with accurate annotations. Secondly, we quantitatively analyze the influence of illumination on re-ID system. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly dissect person re-ID from the aspect of illumination on synthetic dataset. Comprehensive experiments help us have a deeper understanding of the fundamental problems in person re-ID.
